# RCS - Backyard
A system to support administrate your organization (a.k.a. startup, small companies etc.).
The name is backyard because we are developing this with no official support or rules.
Just a smooth system that we hope to work with every organization using the bests practices and technologies.

### Main goals
* Administration of employees
* Expenses controlling

### Directory structure
The build is based in the Angular Sailsjs Boilerplate, made by Tarmo Leppanen.

* backend/    = Just API nothing else
* frontend/   = Angular.js frontend
